10-16 February

Installed required applications and added the framework we decided on
created a new repository
designed basic layout
redesigned checksum display from Figma. Decided that the hashes are too long to display in a nice clean way. Replaced with Instructions for use.
added main button in the middle of the ui surrounded by the traffic light indicators and the buttons for download link and link to new version of file.
